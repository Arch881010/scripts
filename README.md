# scripts
Public Personal Scripts that are accessed via the GitHub pages.
Simply go the the page, and type whatever script you wish, such as banlist.py after the url. Eg: https://arch881010.github.io/scripts/banlist.py
Read through the sripts and figure out which function applies to you, and if that variable is not already in use.
Then it will simply call itself at the end.
